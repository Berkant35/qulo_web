# Store Screenshot Seed Profiles — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create a seed script that inserts 8 premium English female profiles with Unsplash photos and jealousy/hype questions for App Store screenshot capture.

**Architecture:** Single TypeScript script mirroring the existing `seed-test-users.ts` pattern. Hardcoded profile data (no randomization) for consistent, curated screenshot results. Uses Supabase client to insert into `users`, `user_details`, `user_languages`, and `questions` tables.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, tsx runner, @supabase/supabase-js, bcryptjs, dotenv

---

### Task 1: Create seed-store-profiles.ts with profile data

**Files:**
- Create: `qulo-server/scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the script with imports and config**

```typescript
/**
 * Store screenshot profilleri oluşturma scripti
 * Kullanım: npx tsx scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts
 * Silme:    npx tsx scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts --delete
 */

import "dotenv/config";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs";

const SUPABASE_URL = process.env.SUPABASE_URL!;
const SUPABASE_KEY = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!;
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);

const STORE_EMAIL_DOMAIN = "@qulo.test";
const STORE_PASSWORD = "Test1234!";
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the 8 profile definitions**

Each profile is fully hardcoded — no randomization. This ensures consistent, curated data for screenshots.

```typescript
interface StoreProfile {
  email: string;
  name: string;
  surname: string;
  age: number;
  bio: string;

  console.log(`\n🗑️  Delete: npx tsx scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts --delete\n`);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the deleteStoreProfiles function**

```typescript
async function deleteStoreProfiles() {
  console.log("\n🗑️  Deleting store screenshot profiles...\n");

  const { data: storeUsers, error: fetchError } = await supabase
    .from("users")
    .select("id, email")
    .like("email", "store_%@qulo.test");

  if (fetchError) {
    console.error("❌ Error fetching:", fetchError.message);
    return;
  }

  if (!storeUsers || storeUsers.length === 0) {
    console.log("ℹ️  No store profiles found.");
    return;
  }

  const userIds = storeUsers.map((u) => u.id);
  console.log(`  📋 Found ${userIds.length} store profiles`);

  // Delete related records
  const relatedTables = [
    "user_details",
    "user_languages",
    "refresh_tokens",
    "swipes",
    "matches",
    "messages",
    "questions",
    "diamond_transactions",
    "user_badges",
    "referrals",
    "notifications",
  ];

  for (const table of relatedTables) {
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from(table)
      .delete()
      .in("user_id", userIds);

    if (error && !error.message.includes("does not exist")) {
      console.log(`  ⚠️  ${table}: ${error.message}`);
    } else {
      process.stdout.write(`  🧹 ${table} cleaned\n`);
    }
  }

  // Clean swipes/matches where store user is target
  await supabase.from("swipes").delete().in("target_id", userIds);
  await supabase.from("matches").delete().in("user2_id", userIds);

  // Delete users
  const { error: deleteError } = await supabase
    .from("users")
    .delete()
    .like("email", "store_%@qulo.test");

  if (deleteError) {
    console.error("❌ Delete error:", deleteError.message);
    return;
  }

  console.log(`\n✅ ${userIds.length} store profiles and related data deleted.\n`);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the main entry point**

```typescript
// --- Main ---
const isDelete = process.argv.includes("--delete");

if (isDelete) {
  deleteStoreProfiles().catch(console.error);
} else {
  seedStoreProfiles().catch(console.error);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the script to verify it works**

Run:
```bash
cd qulo-server && npx tsx scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts
```

Expected: 8 profiles created with success messages for each.

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify data in Supabase**

Run a quick SQL check:
```sql
SELECT name, age, city, locale, array_length(photos, 1) as photo_count
FROM users WHERE email LIKE 'store_%@qulo.test'
ORDER BY email;
```

Expected: 8 rows, all English, 3-4 photos each.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts
git commit -m "feat: add store screenshot seed profiles script

8 English female profiles with Unsplash photos and jealousy/hype questions
for App Store / Play Store screenshot capture."
```

### Task 2: Verify Unsplash photo URLs load correctly

**Files:** None (verification only)

- [ ] **Step 1: Test photo URLs in browser**

Open each unique Unsplash URL from the profiles to verify they load:

Key URLs to verify (one per profile, first photo):
1. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534528741775-53994a69daeb?w=800&q=80`
2. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529626455594-4ff0802cfb7e?w=800&q=80`
3. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531746020798-e6953c6e8e04?w=800&q=80`
4. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507003211169-0a1dd7228f2d?w=800&q=80`
5. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515023115894-bacee5634647?w=800&q=80`
6. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487412720507-e7ab37603c6f?w=800&q=80`
7. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1464863979621-258859e62245?w=800&q=80`
8. `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516726817505-f5ed825624d8?w=800&q=80`

If any URL returns 404 or shows a non-female/non-portrait image, replace it with a working alternative.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace any broken or unsuitable URLs**

If needed, update the PROFILES array in `seed-store-profiles.ts` and re-run:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts --delete
npx tsx scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit if changes were needed**

```bash
git add scripts/seed-store-profiles.ts
git commit -m "fix: replace broken Unsplash photo URLs in store profiles"
```
